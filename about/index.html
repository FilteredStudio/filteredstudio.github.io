		<p class="ptitle1-bigger">A programmer with too much free time.</p>
		<div style="text-align: left;">
			<p class="pbody">Hey there! I'm a small genderfluid british developer who just makes code for the hell of it. I write music aswell</p>
			<p class="pbody">I dont really know what to put here because I cant describe myself that well without coming off as egotistical, but I'll try :3.</p>
			<p class="pbody">My main skills are based on making code that works and works efficiently, if you would hire me, you'd notice I might leave a lot of debug modules around, dont worry, I'll clean them up when I'm done... probably.</p>
			<p class="pbody">I also make music, as can be seen by going to my SoundCloud linked the navigation bar. Why did I put my socials there, idk.</p>
			
			<p class="pbody">Anyway, this site's a mess and was meant to be a landing page for documentation pages under the same URL, go do something useful with your time.</p>
